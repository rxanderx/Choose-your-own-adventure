# Overview

I created a choose-your-own-adventure game. My software is buit with flexibility in mind, so the framework can be adapted to different formats depending on the type of adventure the player wants to experience. I implemented a text reading system so that the game can be written and stored externally, and then loaded into the framework as a text file in the directory- this way many different adventures can be had using the same software!

I wrote this software so that I could work on my efficiency and ability to implement new things into my python writing. I wanted to learn more about external formatting for a program to process, and I was able to do that with this project.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode to develop this software.

I created this software using python3 with no imported libraries.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Make an additional text file/game to be in the default directory
* Add a menu with functionality to choose to play between multiple files in the directory
* Expand the pointer formatting of the text files so that more paths can be loaded (an increase to 2 digits in the pointer allows for more than 1000 alphanumeric combinations)
